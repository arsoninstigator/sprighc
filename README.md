# sprig games (ysws for hack club)

i initially made a basketball game ( [linked here](https://sprig.hackclub.com/~/VK6tjAtYavpLVkFxun1Q) ) where the push-able sprite (the basketball) was pushed by the player sprite into the solid goal (the basket).

next, during arcade i made a maze game ( [linked here](https://sprig.hackclub.com/~/9OaxqZMDn55IlTtOcATd) ) where the player either finds the exit (progressing to the next level) or falls into a pit (ending the game).

after arcade, i'm making a similar concept maze game with sprig for the ysws sprig console and am trying to give it my own spin as a haunted house. if your sprite is able to find the exit (their way out of the establishment / onto the next level) then they're good, but if they don't, they fall into the bottomless burning pit of boiling molten lava (and lose!)
